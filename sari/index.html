        <h1>Liverpool F.C.</h1>
 <p> 
    Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against
     Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed
      entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those
   days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players
 after a scouting trip to Scotland—so they became known as the "team of Macs".</p>
 

 <p>Liverpool reached its 
 first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 
 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division 
 for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham United centre half George Kay.[7] Liverpool suffered 
 its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal.[8] The club was relegated to the Second 
 Division in the 1953–54 season.[9] Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league Worcester 
 City in the 1958–59 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 
 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could 
 discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other "Boot Room" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and 
 Bob Paisley began reshaping the team.</p>
