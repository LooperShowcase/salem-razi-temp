      Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been
      relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with
      Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing
      rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño
      with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both
      Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five
      consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two
      finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid
      winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which
      included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento, and Raymond Kopa,
      is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[11][12]
      Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the
      world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane, and David Beckham, to
      create a superstar team.[13] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers
      to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000-2006
      and 2009-2018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are
      sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable
      example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also suffered
      under the policy.[14] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for
      a record breaking £80 million (€94 million);[15] he became both the club
      and history's all-time top
